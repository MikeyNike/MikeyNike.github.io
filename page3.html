<dt>I evoke the term <em>'handmade web'</em> </dt>
<dd>in order to draw attention both to the manual labour
    involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a
    'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run.

<p>For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. Readers
have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting,
and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers.</p>
<p>In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called <a href= 
"https://github.com/mroth/unindexed"><em> Unindexed </em></a> which continuously
searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was
permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared the <a href= 
"https://github.com/mroth/unindexed"><em> source code on GitHub </em></a> so you too can
create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it.</p>
<p>Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfortâ€™s <a href= 
    "https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/"><em> Taroko George </em></a> (2008). For
    many, this was their first experience 'making' a computer-generated text.</p>
    <p>I have rewritten <a href= "https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/"><em> Taroko George </em></a> three times. 
    Further to the close relation between the handmade web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output 
    and source code from the first iteration, <a href= "http://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html"><em> Gorge </em>
    </a> (2010), were published in my very small press print book <a href= 
    "http://luckysoap.com/generations/generations.html"><em> GENERATION[S] </em></a> (2010), which, I believe, is now 
    only available as a PDF. <a href= "http://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html"><em> Gorge </em></a> is a 
    never-ending tract of computer-generated text spewing verse approximations, poetic paroxysms
    on food, consumption, decadence, and desire.</p>
