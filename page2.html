            <dt>I evoke the term <em>'handmade web'</em> </dt>
            <dd>in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement with the making of web pages and of web policies

            Anil Dash writes: "In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might
            own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host 
            their online identity."</p>
            <p>In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative
                headline:<a href="https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet">
                <em> Milliions of Facebook users have no idea they're using the internet.</em></a> As the article states: 
                "This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next billion people to 
                come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves."</p>
                <p>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding <a href=
                "https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835"><em> The Great Web 1.0 Revival.</em></a> Its 
                author Kyle Chayka observed:The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level 
                of noise we have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer,
                and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where
                everything was smaller...
            <br>The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social
            network <a href= "http://tilde.club"><em> TILDE CLUB,</em></a>which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For
            some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a contemporary context. For 
            example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net artwork <a href= "http://tilde.club/~olialia/">
            <em>640x480,</em></a> - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served
            as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.

            <p>In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared.<a href= 
            "http://luckysoap.com"><em> My own website,</em></a> including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, 
            is based on a template I created in HomeSite in 1997.</p>
            <p>Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive <a href= 
            "https://www.ubuweb.com"><em> Ubu Web</em></a> site, an "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the 
            avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of <a href= 
            "https://x.com/ubuweb/status/545074372093165568"><em> boasted on Twitter </em></a> that "the whole damn site is still
            hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996."</p>
            <p>I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.</p>
