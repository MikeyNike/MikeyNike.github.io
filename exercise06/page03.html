                    When we look across human existence, objects have
                    always been present around us. From the first weapons
                    used for hunting in the pre-settlement times to our
                    modern phones today, these objects have become a
                    huge part of our everyday life and how we navigate
                    the world around us. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, how many of us truly understand our relationships 
                    with these objects or try to be aware of their presence around 
                    us? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This level of awareness of how we engage with objects goes beyond
                    viewing objects as purely functional to fulfill a purpose. It goes
                    beyond noticing when they break down or malfunction; when they 
                    become “things” and we lose sense of how to interact with them 
                    because they disrupt our expectations.
