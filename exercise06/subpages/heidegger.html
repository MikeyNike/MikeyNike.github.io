                A German philosopher best known for contributions to phenomenology, 
                hermeneutics, and existentialism. His work covers a wide range of topics 
                including ontology, technology, art, metaphysics, humanism, language and history
                of philosophy. He is often considered to be among the most important and 
                influential philosophers of the 20th century, specially in the continental 
                tradition.

                Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, was Heidegger's teacher and a major
                influence on his thought. While the specific lines of influence remain a matter of 
                scholarly dispute. one thing is clear: Heidegger's early work on Being 
                and Time moved away from Husserl's theory of intentionality to focus on the 
                pre-theoretical conditions that enable consciousness to grasp objects.
                Friedrich Nietzsche and Friedrich HÃ¶lderlin also influenced his later works
