                    1. Distinct from that or those mentioned or implied
                    <br>
                    2. To treat or consider as alien to oneself or group
                    <br>
                    3. Used to refer to the a person or thing that has not been
                    mentioned or named
                    <br>
                    4. Opposite or completely different: physically,materially 
                    and/or experientially
                    <br>
                    5. Other/Otherness as a means of identification. To be 
                    unfamiliar, anti-status-quo is to be OTHER. Today, this word 
                    has become synonymous with not falling into the grid of social
                    norms. Anything that can not be explicityl labelled and put
                    into a box or be strictly defined falls under OTHER.
