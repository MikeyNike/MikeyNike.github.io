        <dt>I evoke the term <em> handmade web</em></dt>

    <p>I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for 
        <a href="http://luckysoap.com/butterflies/parasite.html"><em>
        Fishes & Flying Things</em></a> came from the material practices of fine art 
        and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art exhibition I had on 
        at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to            tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that’s the way
        books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story 
        circled round and round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of 
        the book-work, only one copy. The QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest
        cartridge which I still own, but the contents of which I can no longer access. 
        The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still works.
        <br>
        <br>
        The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more 
        symbiotic relationship. This is evident in the early output of the 
        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp"><em> trAce Online Writing 
        Centre</em></a> founded at Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next
        decade trAce evolved into one of the most influential online writing communities 
        in the world. trAce’s first output was a 
        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/writersforthefuture/1995/"><em>word 
        processed photocopied booklet</em></a> which contained links to websites 
        distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,trAce’s last output was also a print
        booklet, in which it is stated: The trAce community embraced both camps, and 
        some early chatlogs contain lively discussions about the use of mixed media in 
        writing.The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce Archive can 
        easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist’s book. 
        (PDF <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/traces/traces.pdf"><em> trAces: 
        A Commemoration of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce</em></a>,page 14)
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the many interesting things about the 
        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp"><em> 
        online archive</em></a> of the trAce Online Writing Centre is how much it 
        reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. 
        Whereas archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts 
        created elsewhere — manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or 
        photographs developed in a darkroom — the handmade web pages contained in this 
        online archive continue to exist in the medium within which they were created.
        That said, the frames through which we view them continue to change.
        <br>
        <br>
        In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" 
        (2011) Wolfgang Ernst observes:"If a radio from a museum collection is 
        reactivated to play broadcast channels of the present, it changes its status: 
        it is not a historical object anymore but actively generates sensual and 
        informational presence." Similarly, when viewing old web pages in modern             browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of 
        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/cyberfest/index.htm"><em> data 
        web-design aesthetics</em></a> overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing 
        earlier versions beneath. Pages optimised for lower resolutions now take 
        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/"><em>less than a third of the 
        screen.</em></a> Ghosts of browsers past mingle with occasional page errors, 
        dead links, and missing images. Sound files play automatically. 
        Warnings abound issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, M.D. Coverley’s 
            <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/coverley/index.html"><em>
            The Personalization of Complexity</em></a> (2001) "explores the ways in which 
            each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized 
            entities, only sometimes manageable by the owners." Fittingly, the piece itself
            warns that it is viewable only on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and 
            Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support many of the features in this 
            essay. These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a
            web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making.

    <p>In <a href="https://www.dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html"><em> 
        The Web We Lost </em></a>(2012) Anil Dash writes: "In the early days of the
        social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own 
        their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent
        on a few big sites to host their online identity."
        In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the 
        provocative headline:
        <a href="https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-
        using-the-internet"><em> Milliions of Facebook users have no idea they're using
        the internet.</em></a> As the article states:"This is more than a matter of 
        semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next billion people to come 
        online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves."
        <br>
        <br>
        In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding 
        <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835"><em> 
        The Great Web 1.0 Revival.</em></a> Its author Kyle Chayka observed:The 
        booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of 
        noise we have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the 
        internet was quieter, safer,and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the 
        close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where everything was smaller...
        <br>
        <br>
        DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the 
        anti-social network <a href= "http://tilde.club"><em> TILDE CLUB,</em></a>
        which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For some, 
        TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a 
        contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users 
        to view a new net artwork 
        <a href= "http://tilde.club/~olialia/"><em>640x480,</em></a> - a 4-tab 
        browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served as 
        little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.
        <a href= "http://tilde.club/~bwalker/"><em>http://tilde.club/~nickc/ http://tilde.club/~bwalker/ http://tilde.club/~willy/</em></a>
        In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared.
        <a href="http://luckysoap.com"><em> My own website,</em></a> including this 
        page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created 
        in HomeSite in 1997.Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated 
        objectives of the massive 
       <a href="https://www.ubuweb.com"><em> Ubu Web</em></a> site, an "independent
       resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and 
       outsider arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of 
       <a href="https://x.com/ubuweb/status/545074372093165568"><em> boasted on 
        Twitter </em></a> that "the whole damn site is still hand-coded in html 1.0
        in bbedit, from templates made in 1996."
        <br>
        <br>
        I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no 
        longer cool.

    <dt>I evoke the term <em>'handmade web'</em></dt>
    <dd>in order to draw attention both to the manual labour
        involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web 
        page itself as a 'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for 
        a computer program to run.

<div class="text01">
    <p>For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. Readers
        have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, 
        copying, pasting,and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers 
        become writers.
        In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called 
        <a href="https://github.com/mroth/unindexed"><em> Unindexed</em></a> which 
        continuously searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being 
        indexed, at which point it was permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared 
        the <a href= "https://github.com/mroth/unindexed"><em> source code on GitHub 
        </em></a> so you too can create a website which self-destructs the moment 
        Google indexes it. Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick 
        Montfort’s <a href="https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/"><em> Taroko George </em></a> 
        (2008). For many, this was their first experience 'making' a computer-generated 
        text. I have rewritten <a href= "https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/"><em> Taroko 
        George </em></a> three times. Further to the close relation between the handmade
        web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output and source code from the
        first iteration, <a href= "http://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html"><em> 
        Gorge </em></a> (2010), were published in my very small press print book 
        <a href= "http://luckysoap.com/generations/generations.html"><em> 
        GENERATION[S] </em></a> (2010), which, I believe, is now only available as 
        a PDF. <a href= "http://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html"><em> Gorge 
        </em></a> is a never-ending tract of computer-generated text spewing verse 
        approximations, poetic paroxysms on food, consumption, decadence, and desire.

    <p> Consider the manual labour carried out by the mouse hand in Daniel Eatock's <a href= "https://www.onemilescroll.com"><em> 
        The One Mile Scroll </em></a> (2008). A few entries appear at the top of the screen - Denver, The Mile High City - my
        grandfather’s grave, Denver - after that we scroll and scroll. The hand is made to work. Through
        the labour of the body the virtual space of the browser window is transformed into an actual,
        physical distance.

        Ironically, handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web. In 
        <a href= "https://theliteraryplatform.com/news/2014/08/from-the-digital-to-the
        -bookbound/"><em> Reading,Writing Interfaces:From the Digital to the Bookbound
        </em></a> (2014), Lori Emerson argues: "The iPad works because users can’t know 
        how it works" (15). Reading the web on an iPhone, iPad, or similar device, 
        readers do not have the option of viewing the page source. The iPad provides
        consumers with access to materials created by others, but cannot easily be used
        as a tool in the handcrafting of new materials.
