    <h1>A Handmade Web . . .</h1>
    <p><dl>
        <dt>The term 'handmade' usually </dt>
        <dd>refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather
            than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in
            a pair of bespoke brogues.</dd>
      <br>
      <br>
        <dt>I evoke the term <b><em>'handmade web'</em></b> </dt>
        <dd>to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
            software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
            corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
            which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
            identity.</dd>
      </dl>
      <br>
      <p>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic
        web and before the corporate web. ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define
        the web of this period.</p>
        <p> In her essay, <a href="https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/"><em>A Vernacular Web</em></a> (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:
            bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and
            personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection
            and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com
            ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.

            amateur web, see:  <a href="https://blog.geocities.institute/about"><em>A Vernacular Web</em></a> </p>
