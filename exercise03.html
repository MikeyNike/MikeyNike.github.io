              <dt>The term 'handmade' usually </dt>
                <dd>refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather
                    than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay 
                    ashtray — or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues.</dd>

                <dd>to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
                    software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than 
                    by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, 
                    temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions 
                    of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
                    identity.</dd>

          <p>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic
            web and before the corporate web. ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define
            the web of this period.
            In her essay, <a href="https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/"><em>A Vernacular Web</em>
            </a> (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:bright, rich, personal, slow and 
            under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on 
            the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer... it was
            a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and 
            guidelines designed by usability experts. For more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan 
            Espenschied's excellent research on the amateur web, see:
